This is exactly what is done when makeing the vector, all the information about the text is trown away and it's just couting towards the document how many times a certain word is written. This works good in combination with Naive Bayes, because Naive Bayes sees all the values aswell as independent, which means that it does just as Bags of Words, not does anything with the information of \"related\" values. Both models see the words as independend values.    "
